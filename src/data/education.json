      "summary": "Outlines a method for determining the far-field radiation pattern of an electrically large integrated lens antenna. Rays are traced from the phase center of an antenna aperture, refracted from the lens boundary, and then sampled on a plane in front of the lens. The far-field is then computed using a near-field to far-field transformation from fields on this plane. The results are compared with time-domain simulations in CST Microwave Studio."
